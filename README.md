# Do Meaningful Dimensions of Childhood Adversity Exist? Data-Driven Evidence from Two Prospective Cohort Studies
This repository provides scripts for all analytical steps involved in the study "Do Meaningful Dimensions of Childhood Adversity Exist? Data-Driven Evidence from Two Prospective Cohort Studies". The scripts can be run in R. 

"abcd-dimensions" derives dimensions of childhood adversity from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study.

"mcs-dimensions" derives dimensions of childhood adversity from the Millennium Cohort Study.

Both scripts perform the following analyses:

0. Merging raw measures of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) into a single dataset.
1. Deriving ACE measures, psychopathology outcomes, and auxiliary variables.
2. Exploratory factor analysis.
3. Multivariate multiple regression.
4. Multiple imputation.
5. Re-deriving all measures on the imputed dataset.
6. Replicating all analyses on the imputed dataset.
